# rt-1-weekend
> Single-threaded CPU-based Raytracer made with "Raytracing in 1 Week" book. A lot of terrible code here. Made just for fun. :p

I'm currently working on refactoring it.

## Compilation and use

```
make
./rt > image.ppm
```

After finished, the final rendered image will appear in the filesystem. Just open it and see the result.
